#  Scala for data science examples

This repostory contains the code examples for Scala for data science. To run the examples, start by installing [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html), the (main) build tool for Scala projects.

Once you have installed SBT, download this repository using:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pbugnion/s4ds.git
    
You can then navigate to each chapter and (apart from a few specific chapters) type `sbt run` in a terminal to run the source code, or `sbt console` to open a Scala console with all the dependencies for that particular chapter.
