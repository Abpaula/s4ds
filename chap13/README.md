# Chapter 13

This chapter explores the Play framework. We build a web API, `ghub-display`, that provides 
a JSON array describing a user's repositories.

You need to install Â§Typesafe Activator for this API to work, using either 

    brew install typesafe-activator

on a Mac, or by downloading the JAR from:

    https://www.typesafe.com/activator/download

To run the application, cd to the `ghub-display` directory and type:

    activator run

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:9000` in your browser to see the application.
