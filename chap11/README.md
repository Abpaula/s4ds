# Chapter 11: Spark SQL and DataFrames

We introduce Spark DataFrames, an abstraction for manipulating tables of data distributed across several computers.

Most of the examples in the book run in the Spark shell, and are therefore not reproduced here.

We provide a single utility file, `FetchData.scala`, which can be used to fetch and transform the repos or Martin Odersky from the GitHub API. Run this with SBT.
