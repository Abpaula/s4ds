# Chapter 3: Plotting with breeze-viz

 * `HWData.scala`: Routines to help load the height-weight data from CSVs.
 * `BreezeDemo.scala`: Example code for plotting simple x-y plots, scatter plots (including scatter plots with variable point size and color) and multiple plots on one figure.
 * `ScatterplotMatrix.scala` contains a class for plotting [scatterplot matrices](http://www.utexas.edu/courses/schwab/sw388r7/Tutorials/IllustrationofRegressionAnalysis_doc_html/024_The_Scatterplot_Matrix.html). Run `ScatterPlotMatrixDemo` to see this in action.

The `data` directory contains *height*-*weight* that we use as example data in this chapter.
